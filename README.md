# My-Portofolio
While a portfolio is supposed to show your creativity and vibe, it should also have a clear structure for the person viewing it. You don't want someone scrolling through your site for ages just to miss your name or your best work.

Here are four basic sections so you know what to include in a portfolio:

1.Introduction: Who are you, besides what you do for work? This is where you include a little homepage to welcome people to your portfolio and introduce yourself. 

2.Your work: Here's where you want to make a big impact. Choose your favorite projects that showcase your passions, skills, and experience. Display them in a way that also fits your industry and creative process. List your accomplishments and do some self-promotion. 

3.Your services: Are you a graphic designer who offers web development, knows different tools and is looking for full-time work? Say that here. It'll help solidify what you're looking for and available to do. If you’re open to freelance projects, it might help to list what type and what rates you charge.

4.Contact information: Once you've wowed someone with your portfolio, they’ll want to get in touch. A dedicated contact page or contact form is how you'll hear from hiring managers or potential clients.
